BEM --> Block Element Model 


Designed and developed a full-stack web application using React. To manage the application's state, I implemented Redux Toolkit, a powerful toolset for managing state in a predictable and efficient way.

To create an appealing and user-friendly interface, I utilized Ant Design, a comprehensive UI design system that provides a wide range of components and patterns for building responsive and accessible web applications. In addition, I used Chart.js, a JavaScript library for data visualization, to create dynamic and interactive charts that allow users to easily understand complex data.

To ensure that the application provides up-to-date information, I implemented data fetching from multiple sources using RapidAPI, a platform that provides a range of APIs for accessing data from various sources. This allowed the application to provide real-time information to users, making it a valuable resource for data-driven decision-making.
